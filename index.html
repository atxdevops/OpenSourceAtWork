							I'm going to try and avoid religious wars.
							You may question some of my word choices (esp: pronouns) and I have reasons for them. Take a note and sit tight.
							Specifically in 9th Circuit (AK AZ CA HI ID MO NV OR WA) Oracle v Google has made a lot of changes.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
