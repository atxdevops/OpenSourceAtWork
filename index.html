							"I give you source code, you give me your changes back, we're even. That's my take on GPLv2. It's that simple. Version 3 extended that in ways I personally am really uncomforable with. I give source code, that means that if you use that source code you can't use it on your device unless you follow my rules." -<a href="https://youtu.be/5PmHRSeA2c8?t=47m46s">Linus Torvalds at DebConf 14</a>

							I can't tell you how many times people tell me what they think the GPL does, and they are wrong. This one just gives me such facepalm.
							FUD around the CDDL is also at an all time high for similar reasons. I use ZFS, I'm comfortable with it. I mostly just don't give people outside my org binary packages.

							Which means if you wrote code while at work, it’s not yours anymore, it’s your company’s. That means you cannot assign a license to it or agree to the terms of a license. Only your company can.
